Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-05-05

Summary
Share Secrets is designed with privacy and minimal data collection in mind. The core principle is zero-trust: encryption and decryption occur entirely in the user's browser. The server never receives plaintext secrets or user passphrases.

What we store
- Ciphertext only: encrypted secret blobs sent by clients (this includes encrypted file payloads and any associated metadata; the server never receives decrypted file contents or filenames).
- Minimal metadata required for operation: creation timestamp, expiration, and one-time access state.
- Short-lived in-memory storage (no persistent database by default).

What we do not collect
- Plaintext secrets, user passphrases, plaintext files, or filenames.
- Names, emails, or other personal identifiers by default.
- Persistent analytics or user-tracking data.

Logs & debugging
- Short-lived server logs may include request IDs and timestamps for debugging. Logs should not contain plaintext secrets.
- Avoid logging encrypted content blobs or file data; only store minimal diagnostic identifiers for troubleshooting.

Self-hosting
- If you self-host Share Secrets, you control all data and retention policies. The MIT license permits running and modifying the software to meet your privacy requirements.
